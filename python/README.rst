onshape\_client
===============

A Python client for using the Onshape REST API.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Python 3.7+

Installation
------------

-  pip (latest released version): ``pip install onshape-client``
-  `setup authentication </README.md#authentication>`__

Examples
--------

Quickstart examples showing the power of the API. For more examples,
refer to our tests.

>>> from onshape_client import OnshapeElement, Client
>>> client = Client()

Upload And Translate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Synchronous uploads:

>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> new_doc = OnshapeElement.create("Engine")
>>> translated_geometry = Path().cwd() / "test" / "assets"/ "translated_geometry"
>>> imported_part_studio = new_doc.import_file(translated_geometry / "Cube.x_t", allow_faulty_parts=True)
>>> imported_part_studio.name
'Cube'

Batch parallel uploads:

>>> new_doc = OnshapeElement.create("Batch Uploads")
>>> files_to_upload = [translated_geometry / "Cube.x_t", translated_geometry / "Cube.step"]
>>> threads = [client.api_client.pool.apply_async(new_doc.import_file, [file]) for file in files_to_upload]
>>> sorted([t.get().name for t in threads])
['Cube', 'Cube (1)']


Data Inspection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Python client gives you programmatic access to document data.

>>> violin = OnshapeElement("https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c1aa5bba6a0139ebb12ce0bd/v/53133b26e489a6f6d3da0fba/e/221fb58cf7a7524ff4d663aa")
>>> print(f"To print this violin will take {violin.mass_properties.bodies['-all-'].volume[0]*1000000:4.2f} cm^3 of SLA solution.")
To print this violin will take 609.95 cm^3 of SLA solution.

The best place to see intended use and supported functionality is within `onshape_clients/python/test </python/test>`__. All the parameters declared in a given test function are brought in from `onshape_clients/python/test/conftest.py </onshape_clients/python/test/conftest.py>`__. So, to create a simple script that replicates a test, just recursively include the code brought in from each "fixture".

Troubleshooting
---------------
- **The client returns None instead of the expected type.**
  This is caused by a deserialization error in the response because not all responses are 100% described by the spec while still in beta. In the meantime, you can still get the response by adding `_preload_content=False` to the request method. Please file an issue mentioning the problematic endpoint on this repo.
- **ApiTypeError.**
  Could be caused by the client type checking on either the response or the request. You can ignore such an error by setting `_check_return_type=False` to turn off return type checking and `_check_input_type=False` to turn off input type checking.

Gotchas and Additional Caveats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Endpoint call throwing ``ApiValueError``: most likely this is caused by an incorrectly typed endpoint. Please submit an issue to the onshape-clients repository, and in the meantime you can use the ``_preload_content=False`` argument to avoid deserialization entirely. Here is an example where the standard serialization and deserialization are entirely avoided:

Deserialize manually:

>>> response=client.part_studios_api.get_part_studio_mass_properties(_preload_content=False, **violin._get_DWMVE())
>>> import json
>>> response_dict = json.loads(response.data)
>>> print(f"{response_dict['bodies']['-all-']['volume'][0]*1000000:4.2f}")
609.95

Serialize manually:

>>> response = client.documents_api.create_document(_check_input_type=False, _preload_content=False, bt_document_params={'name':'self-serialized test'})
>>> assert response.status==200
